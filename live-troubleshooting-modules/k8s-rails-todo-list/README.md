### SCENARIO:
Its your first week at Think and the developers come to you with a problem.....

The CTO is presenting a demo to clients of a brand new application that the team whipped up over the weekend.   They explain that the presentation is in an hour, they've already tried deploying the application to our development kubernetes cluster and its not working! 

    curl https://techops-interview.dev.gcp.trchq.com/
    curl: (7) Failed to connect to techops-interview.dev.gcp.trchq.com port 443: Connection refused

They think that its to do with the kubernetes cluster itself, because this 100% worked in their local environment. They aren't quite sure whats wrong though, and ask you to help troubleshoot with them.
